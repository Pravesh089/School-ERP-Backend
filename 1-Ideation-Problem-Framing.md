# Phase 1: Ideation & Problem Framing

## 1. Problem Statement

> **Schools rely on physical registers and notebooks to manage academic, administrative, and student-related data, leading to inefficiency, data inconsistency, difficulty in retrieval, lack of analytics, and high operational overhead.**

The goal is to build a **web-based School Management System** that digitizes these records with **role-based access**, **auditability**, and **simple reporting**, without unnecessary complexity.

### Current Pain Points
*   📒 **Multiple physical registers** (attendance, marks, fees, exams)
*   🔍 **Slow data retrieval** (finding old records)
*   ❌ **Data duplication and human errors**
*   🔐 **No access control** (anyone can see/edit registers)
*   📊 **No analytics** (performance trends, attendance insights)
*   🔄 **No backup or disaster recovery**
*   📢 **Manual communication** with students/parents

## 2. Stakeholders & User Roles

*   Overall control
*   Data governance
*   Reports & compliance

### 2️⃣ Teachers
*   Attendance tracking
*   Marks entry
*   Student performance tracking

### 3️⃣ Students
*   View attendance
*   View marks
*   Notifications
*   *Note: Parents access the system via Student credentials (read-only).*

## 3. Scope Definition

### ✅ In Scope (MVP)
*   **Authentication & Role-Based Access**
*   **Academic Structure** (Classes, Sections, Subjects)
*   **Student Information System**
*   **Attendance Management**
*   **Marks & Exams**
*   **Fee Management** (Head, Structure, Ledger)
*   **Timetable / Class Scheduling**
*   **Basic Reporting Dashboard**

### ❌ Out of Scope (for now)
*   Online classes
*   Video conferencing
*   Learning Content (LMS)
*   Transport
*   Government integrations
